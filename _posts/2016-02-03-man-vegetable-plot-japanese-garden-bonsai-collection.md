## The Question!

A man, his vegetable plots, Japanese garden, bonsai collection and the trials feeding a family from said vegetables plots.  The simple idea grew from the ever increases cost of "organic" vegetables and the struggle to feed my family quality produce at a cost that wasn't going to send me broke. 

So the question: Can i grow and feed my family all their vegetable needs out of my own Melbourne suburban back yard? So join me for the journey with all its failings, conquests and lets see if this question can be answered "YES". 

Here is an article about how i came to have my current "Japanese" garden and how i built/designed it: link [A DIY Japanese Garden][0]. I'll get around to taking some more recent photos soon. Here is one from last year in which you can just see the old vegetable garden in the background on the right.
