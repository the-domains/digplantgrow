# Man.   
Vegetable Plot.   
Japanese Garden.  
Bonsai Collection.

A man, his vegetable plots, Japanese garden, bonsai collection along with the trials feeding a family from said vegetables plots.  The simple idea grew from the ever increases cost of "organic" vegetables and the struggle to feed my family quality produce at a cost that wasn't going to send me broke. 

So the question: Can i grow and feed my family all their vegetable needs out of my own Melbourne suburban back yard?

Lets take the journey along with all failings and conquers and see what the outcome will be. Here is an article how i came to have my current "Japanes" garden and how i built/designed it: link [A DIY Japanese Garden][0]. A more recent moody photo is attached although this part of my backyard is forever changing and i hope to get some updated photos and a bit of an explanation about it.
