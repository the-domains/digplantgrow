# Building the vegetable plots.

Not been a builder this was a first for me. Though didn't really look that difficult. The previous vegetable garden i built out of old railway sleepers i found buried thought out the "garden" and some bamboo stakes. It worked well and we got a lot of produce out of it. Just not at the volume i wanted. Old plot pictured below.
